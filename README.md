# Functional data structures in F#

One of the things I enjoyed when discovering for the first time functional programming, was how it reveals
patterns that traditional imperative programming hides. I was delighted to discover how implementing [Breadth-First Search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search) with the sort of restrictions we  expect from functional programming, also reveals hidden patterns.

Another surprise is that F# is a great candidate to explore functional data structures, which seem could be 
a good update to the excellent work by [Chris Okasaki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Okasaki#Purely_functional_data_structures)
